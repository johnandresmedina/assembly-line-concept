# Written Response

## Thoughts on the exercise

It was fun to think about the structure of a possible solution and then came up with a design and working solution. I appreciate more this types of exercises because of the practical component that it evaluates and its real-life case proximity.

## Challenges Faced

One of the challenges I faced while writting this app was handling the left-click and right-click,
it's not a frequent use case therefore some investigation was required.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time I would like to improve the main reducer of the AssemblyLine component, using a library like [Immer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immer) will make the logic simple to read/understand and mantain in the future.

In addition to that adding some type of prop checking like [PropTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) or TypeScript will make the code safer and less prone to errors/bugs.

> It was fun to code. Thank you for your time!
